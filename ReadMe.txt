This code is a simple implementation of building and mining a blockchain using Flask. Here's a breakdown of what the different sections do:

1. Importing necessary libraries: datetime, hashlib, json, flask.
2. Building the Blockchain Class
	- Methods included are:
		- Init method to initialize an empty blockchain list and create a genesis block with proof = 1 and previous_hash = '0'.
		- Method to create new blocks by adding them to the blockchain list.
			- Each block contains an index, timestamp, proof, and previous_hash.
		- Method to get the last block in the chain.
		- Method for generating proof of work for new blocks.
			- It takes previous_proof as argument and returns a new proof.
			- Proof of work algorithm calculates hash of difference square of new proof and previous proof.
			- The resulting hash must start with four zeros.
		- Method for hashing the blocks.
			- It takes a block as input and returns a sha256 hash of the block in hexadecimal format.
		- Method to check if a given blockchain is valid or not.
			- It takes a blockchain as input and validates it.
